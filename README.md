**What does the project do?**
This project analyzes the aerosol optical depth (AOD at 470 nm and 440 nm) during the 2020 wildfire season in Southeastern South America. It combines satellite-derived data (from MAIAC/MODIS) and ground-based measurements (AERONET) to evaluate the impact of biomass burning on air quality in the region, focusing on cities such as Buenos Aires and Montevideo.

**Why is the project useful?**
The project provides critical insights into the effects of wildfires on regional air quality and public health. By integrating satellite and ground-based observations, it improves our understanding of aerosol behavior and offers valuable tools for researchers studying air pollution.

**How can users get started with the project?**
To get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```

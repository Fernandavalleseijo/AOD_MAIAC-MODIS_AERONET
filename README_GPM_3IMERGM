DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

Version 07 B is the current version of the IMERG data sets. Older versions will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.

The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.

The precipitation estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW) sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2021 version of the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2021), then gridded, intercalibrated to the GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly 0.1째x0.1째 (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over high-latitude ocean to correct known biases.

SHARING/ACCESS INFORMATION

Licenses/restrictions placed on the data: GPM and TRMM data are freely available at all levels for which the particular sensor or sensor combination has been processed by GPM. For the GPM Core Observatory this is for Levels 0 through 3 products (as applicable).  For the partner satellites in the GPM constellation this is Levels 1c through 3 (as applicable). Users are encouraged to access data from the primary GPM and TRMM archives (i.e. nasa.gov domains at Goddard Space Flight Center). When data from secondary archives are used, it is incumbent on the user to verify that the data values accessed are accurate, up-to-date, current-version copies of the original data. Data format questions should be directed to the relevant archive site, while science questions should be sent to the dataset developers. Finally, dataset users are asked to report errors and difficulties in the dataset to the dataset creators using the contact form below.
